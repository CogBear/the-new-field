  		A new field lay beneath my window
  		</h1>
      <p>It was green and wide, and dotted with tiny white flowers. The sky was mostly clear, though I could see clouds in the distance.</p>
      <p>I heard a faint and soft melody emanating from the forest nearby.</p>

  <p>An unsettling notion crept in the back of my mind, and I was perturbed to find my feet shuffling toward the darkness.</p>
